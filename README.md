# This is the Automated Terraform Wordpress deploy project

I want to showcase how to build and setup a wordpress website that is highly available, scalable and performant. 
With this we will be able to setup our own wordpress blog and personal website to create more visibility.  

Automation and scaling of wordpress website/blog utilizing AWS CLI and Terraform.  
I wanted to showcase my DevOps capabilities and how to best implement a wordpress blog with the tools AWS provides.   
The focus is on automated and monitored scaling that allows the user a hands-off approach on using Wordpress in their environment.  

# Overview
With this infrastructure built around the WordPress Instance we want to enable a highly available Website/Blog. In order to do so we utilized the AWS Cloud and built it automatically with Terraform.

## What did we use?

Amazon Webservices - to host all the components in the cloud  
Terraform - to automate the setup of the architecture  
Visual Studio Code - as IDE  
Amazon Linux 2 - as EC2 (Virtual Machine) Operating System  
Wordpress - as Website Builder for our Blog  
MySQL - as Database for Wordpress  
Git - as Versioning tool  
Bash - for the User Data Script
